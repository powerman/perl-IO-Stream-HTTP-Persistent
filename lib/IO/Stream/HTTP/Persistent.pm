        ...
        wait_for => EOF|HTTP_SENT|HTTP_RECV,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is plugin for L<IO::Stream> which allow you to process
complete HTTP requests and responses read/written by this stream.
It's useful only for persistent HTTP connections (HTTP/1.0 with Keep-Alive
and HTTP/1.1).

On usual HTTP/1.0 non-persistent connections it's ease to detect sent HTTP
request using SENT event and received HTTP response using EOF event.
But on persistent connections that's become much more complicated: to
detect end of single received HTTP response (or boundaries between several
received responses) you have to parse HTTP protocol, and when HTTP/1.1
Pipelining is used it's not easy to find out how many complete requests
was already sent.

This module will parse HTTP protocol for sent and received data, and will
generate non-standard events HTTP_SENT and HTTP_RECV when one or more
complete HTTP requests will be sent or HTTP responses received.
It will provide you with list of sizes for each sent request and received
response, which make it ease to find how many requests was sent or get
separate responses from {in_buf}.


=head1 EXPORTS

This modules doesn't export any functions/methods/variables, but it exports
some constants. There two groups of constants: events and errors
(which can be imported using tags ':Event' and ':Error').
By default all constants are exported.

Events:

    HTTP_SENT HTTP_RECV

Errors:

    HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE HTTP_ERESINCOMPLETE

Errors are similar to $! - they're dualvars, having both textual and numeric
values.


=head1 INTERFACE 

=over

=item new()

Create and return new IO::Stream plugin object.

=back


=head1 PUBLIC FIELDS

=over

=item in_sizes =[]

=item out_sizes =[]

Size of each complete sent HTTP request or received HTTP response
will be pushed into these fields.

You can remove elements from these arrays if you need, but you should
keep these fields in ARRAYREF format.

=back


=head1 EVENTS

=over

=item HTTP_SENT

=item HTTP_RECV

These non-standard events will be generated when one or more complete HTTP
requests will be sent or one or more HTTP responses will be received.
Their sizes will be push()ed into fields {out_sizes} and {in_sizes} before
generating events.

Instead of using these events you can use standard IN and OUT events and
check is new items was added to {out_sizes} and {in_sizes}.

=back


=head1 ERRORS

=over

=item HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE

All HTTP headers of one request MUST be appended to {out_buf} using
single $io->write(), otherwise you'll get HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE.
It's safe to add request body after that using any amount of $io->write().

You can safely continue I/O after receiving HTTP_EREQINCOMPLETE, but after
that error you'll not get HTTP_SENT event and {out_sizes} won't be updated
anymore.

=item HTTP_ERESINCOMPLETE

Unexpected EOF happens while receiving HTTP response.

=back


=head1 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item

This plugin usually should be first (top) plugin in IO::Stream object's
plugin chain, because if upper plugins will somehow modify {in_buf} or
{out_buf} then values in {in_sizes} and {out_sizes} may become wrong.

=item

{out_buf} MUST NOT be modified in any way except by appending new data.

=item

Partial HTTP response in {in_buf} MUST NOT be modified.
It's safe to cut from start of {in_buf} complete HTTP responses.

=back
